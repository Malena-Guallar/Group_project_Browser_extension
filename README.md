# Browser extension - Group project

### About this project

As a group of three persons we had to create a Chrome extension. 
We decided to create a homepage extension which displays a customed page on every new tab opening.
First installing the extension, the user would find on the main page a form asking to enter its name and zodiac sign. 
Then on its later visits, the user would find a welcoming message, the time and weather, and its daily horoscope. 

During this project I mostly worked on the global architecture of the extension : creating a form and implementing functions to stock data in browser local storage, then displaying a custom page for each user. I customed the API requests with the data from local storage and the date, to display a horoscope that changes in accordance with the sign of the user, and of course changes everyday.
I also implemented a search bar to use the search engine DuckduckGo. 
We chose to display a nice design with animation from a SVG code we found on the web on top of some CSS work.
