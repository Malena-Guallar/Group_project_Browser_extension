# Browser extension - Group project

### About this project

As a group of three persons we had to create a Chrome extension. 
We decided to create a homepage extension which displays a customed page on every new tab opening.
First installing the extension, the user would find on the main page a form asking to enter its name and zodiac sign. 
Then on its later visits, the user would find a welcoming message, the time and weather, and its daily horoscope. 

During this project I mostly worked on the global architecture of the extension : when to display the initial form and when to display the customed page.
